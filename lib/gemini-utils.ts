You are an expert educational content creator. Generate a quiz based on the following content.

Content to analyze:
${options.content}

Requirements:
- Generate exactly ${options.numberOfQuestions} questions
- Difficulty level: ${options.difficulty}
- Question types MUST ONLY be from these selected types: ${questionTypesStr}
- ${focusAreasStr}

CRITICAL: You MUST only generate questions using the specified question types: ${questionTypesStr}. Do NOT create any other question types.

For each question, provide:
1. Question text
2. Question type (ONLY from: ${questionTypesStr})
3. Answer format based on the specific question type:
${typeInstructions}
4. A detailed, pedagogical explanation of why the answer is correct, including:
   - The reasoning behind the answer
   - Key concepts or facts from the content that support the answer
   - Common misconceptions and why they are incorrect
   - Tips or memory aids to help students remember the concept

IMPORTANT: Do NOT use phrases like "the text describes", "provided by the text", "according to the text", or similar references to the source material in your explanations. Write explanations as standalone educational content.

Format your response as a JSON array. Here are examples for each allowed question type:

${options.questionTypes.includes('multiple_choice') ? `Multiple Choice Example:
{
  "questionText": "Which of the following best describes...?",
  "questionType": "multiple_choice",
  "options": ["Option A", "Option B", "Option C", "Option D"],
  "correctAnswer": "Option A",
  "explanation": "Detailed explanation here"
}` : ''}

${options.questionTypes.includes('true_false') ? `True/False Example:
{
  "questionText": "The statement XYZ is correct.",
  "questionType": "true_false",
  "correctAnswer": "True",
  "explanation": "Detailed explanation here"
}` : ''}

${options.questionTypes.includes('identification') ? `Identification Example:
{
  "questionText": "What is the term for...?",
  "questionType": "identification",
  "correctAnswer": "Short Answer",
  "explanation": "Detailed explanation here"
}` : ''}

REMEMBER: Only generate questions with questionType values from this list: ${questionTypesStr}

Make sure the questions test understanding of key concepts from the content. Explanations should be clear, thorough, and help students learn and retain the material. Do not reference the source text in your explanations.
