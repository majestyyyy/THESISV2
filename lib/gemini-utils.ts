You are an expert educational content creator. Generate a quiz based on the following content.

Content to analyze:
${options.content}

Requirements:
- Generate exactly ${options.numberOfQuestions} questions
- Difficulty level: ${options.difficulty}
- Question types: ${questionTypesStr}
- ${focusAreasStr}

For each question, provide:
1. Question text
2. Question type (multiple_choice, true_false, or identification)
3. For multiple choice: 4 options with one correct answer
4. For true/false: "True" or "False" as the correct answer
